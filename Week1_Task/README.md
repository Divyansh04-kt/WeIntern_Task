# Console Based Student Management System 
Project Description

The Student Management System is a menu-driven Java console application designed to manage student records efficiently.
The system allows users to add, view, update, delete, and search student details.
It follows the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and modular programming, where each functionality is implemented using separate methods to ensure better readability, reusability, and maintainability.

Objectives

1) To implement Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Java
2) To perform CRUD operations on student records
3) To use ArrayList for data storage

Features

1) Menu-driven interface
2) Add new student records
3) View all student records
4) Update existing student details
5) Delete student records
6) Search students by ID and Name
7) Proper input validation

Concepts Used

1) Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
2) Java methods (modular programming)
3) ArrayList for dynamic data storage
4) Loops and conditional statements
5) switch-case
6) Scanner class for input handling

Program Flow

1) Display menu options to the user
2) Accept user choice
3) Validate input
4) Call the corresponding method
5) Perform the requested operation
6) Display the result
7) Repeat until the user exits
